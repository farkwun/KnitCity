# KnitCity
##the project
This repository contains Arduino code for the Knitwear Printer project made at MHacks.
[The blog post about the rationale behind the project](https://medium.com/mhacks-v/i-dream-of-knitting-machines-5473377de5be)

##current specs
The machine planned at MHacks can only do the knit stitch. This is done using a "T-manipulator". A symmetrical T-manipulator can be added on the opposite side to allow the machine to do a purl stitch. The machine will not be able to cast on and bind off (nor can the Brother knitting machines from the 80s, or any other knitting machine that I know of).

##using the machine
First, stitches must be cast on. The [long tailed cast on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wUPQDYtoy0) is ideal, as the loops are less likely to loose their shape compared to the [single cast on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXWw2eMFc5k). The cast on should be done on 2 needles so that the loops are loose enough to be grabbed when they sit on one needle. The cast on stitches must be pushed to the edge of the needle before the machine starts knitting.

##resources
The T-manipulator works by using two claws to transfer loops of yarn, and one crochet hook to pull a new loop of yarn through loops from the previous row. Additional explanatory diagrams and the cost of some of the parts can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1izEyOQ_KWICfKyjrefoc_-a8f4IfAC1EF__0_PTAb98/edit?usp=sharing)

The frame of the T-manipulator is 3D printed (links to 3D models to be added soon).
